> A plugin that can retrieve and cache images from AWS S3 Buckets


## How to Use

The plugin supports custom urls to a AWS S3 Bucket

`s3:[objectKey]`

This will download the file that is found with the specific objectKey and cache it locally. Subsequent urls that point to the same urls will use the file from the cache. The `obsidian-plugin-s3-link` will regularly check if a newer version is available in the bucket but only download the file if it is necessary.

`s3-sign[objectKey]`

With the `s3-sign` scheme the plugin will create a signed url instead of downloading the file itself. The signed url that is created is valid for 7 days and the plugin will create a new one automatically once it is expired.

> **_Note:_** Signed urls can not be used with the embed functionality. Embedded links expect a local file. The following documentation shows which links support signed urls.

### Image Links

The classic markdown way of embedding images.

Markdown image link

```
![](s3:[objectKey])
```

Markdown signed url link
```
![](s3-sign:[objectKey])
```

### Anchor Links

Markdown Link

```
[Name of the link](s3:[objectKey])
```

> This will create a clickable link that opens the file within obsidian

```
[Name of the link](s3-sign:[objectKey])
```

This will create a link that opens the file within the browser

### Video Links

HTML video link

```
<video src="s3:[objectKey]" controls=""></video>
```

HTML video sign link

```
<video src="s3-sign:[objectKey]" controls=""></video>
```

Obsidian Video Embed

```
![[s3:[objectKey]]]
```

> **_Note:_** Signed urls are not supported

### PDF Links

```
![[s3:[objectKey]]]
```

> **_Note:_** Signed urls are not supported

### Sound Links

```
![[s3:[objectKey]]]
```

> **_Note:_** Signed urls are not supported


### Configuration

##### S3 Bucket Name

The AWS S3 Bucket name

##### S3 Bucket Region

The Region the AWS S3 Bucket resides in

##### AWS Credentials

The plugin supports authentication via credentials file in `~/.aws/credentials` or via Access Key Id and Secret Access Key.

> **_Note:_** It is recommended to use the profile to prevent credentials being stored withing obsidian

###### AWS Profile

##### S3 Bucket CORS configuration

The AWS S3 Buckets needs to have CORS configured to allow requests from Obsidian.

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET",
            "HEAD"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]
```

##### AWS IAM User

Example IAM configuration for user read access to an S3 Bucket

```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucketVersions",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],

            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::[bucketname]",
            "Sid": ""
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::[bucketname]/*",
            "Sid": ""
        }
    ],

}
```
