> A plugin that retrieves and caches objects from AWS S3 Buckets

## Overview

The plugin supports custom URLs to an AWS S3 Bucket, allowing users to retrieve and cache files from S3 efficiently.

### Usage

To retrieve files:

* **Standard URL:** `s3:[objectKey]`
    * Downloads and caches the file locally. It checks periodically for newer versions in the S3 bucket but only downloads if a newer version exists.
* **Signed URL:** `s3-sign[objectKey]`
    * Creates a signed URL instead of downloading the file. The generated signed URL is valid for 7 days and will be automatically renewed after expiration.

> Note: Signed URLs cannot be used with embed functionality, as embedded links expect a local file. The documentation below specifies which links support signed URLs.

### Embedding Content

- **Image Links:**
```markdown
![](s3:[objectKey])
![](s3-sign:[objectKey])
```

- **Anchor Links:**
```markdown
[Name of the link](s3:[objectKey])
[Name of the link](s3-sign:[objectKey])
```

> The first link opens the file within Obsidian, while the second opens it in the browser.

- **Video Links:**
```markdown
<video src="s3:[objectKey]" controls></video>
<video src="s3-sign:[objectKey]" controls></video>
```

> Note: Signed URLs are not supported for obsidian video embeds.

- **PDF & Sound Links:**
```markdown
![[s3:[objectKey]]]
```

> Note: Signed URLs are not supported.

### Configuration

Before using the plugin, some basic configuration is needed:

- **S3 Bucket Name:** Specify the AWS S3 Bucket name.
- **S3 Bucket Region:** Define the region where the AWS S3 Bucket resides.
- **AWS Credentials:** Authenticate using the `~/.aws/credentials` file or the Access Key Id and Secret Access Key.
    - **AWS Profile:** The plugin checks all profiles in `~/.aws/credentials`.
    - **AWS Access Key ID:** Your AWS IAM user's Access Key ID.
    - **AWS Secret Access Key:** Your AWS IAM user's Secret Access Key.

> Note: Using the profile is recommended to avoid storing credentials directly within Obsidian.

- **S3 Bucket CORS Configuration:** Ensure the S3 Bucket has CORS configured to accept requests from Obsidian.
```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET",
            "HEAD"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]
```
- **AWS IAM User:** An example IAM configuration for user read access to an S3 Bucket. 
```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucketVersions",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::[bucketname]",
            "Sid": ""
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::[bucketname]/*",
            "Sid": ""
        }
    ],
    "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```
